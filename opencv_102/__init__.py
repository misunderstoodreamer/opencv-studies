some information for opencv-102:

GRADIENT MAGNITUDE = Square Root of the sum of the squared gradients
VALUE OF THE GRADIENT OF THE BACKGROUND IMAGE = 0
GRADIENT ORIENTATION (XY-AXIS) = Square Root of the arctangets of gradients in x and y directions.
RANGE OF GRADIENT ORIENTATION = [0, 180]
TO MEASURE HOW STRONG THE CHANGE IN IMAGE INTENSITY = Gradient Magnitude Appliying
CHARACTERISTICS OF OUTPUT IMAGE OF WIDE CANNY THRESHOLD = High Freqeuncy Noise
CHARACTERISTICS OF OUTPUT IMAGE OF TIGHT CANNY THRESHOLD = Detects less structural edges
